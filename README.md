- Five pre-defined physical therapy exercises:
  - Finger Flexion
  - Thumb Abduction
  - Wrist Rotation
  - Grip Opening
  - Finger Tapping
- Live webcam video feed with score and feedback overlay
- Automatic repetition counting based on gesture accuracy
- Final session summary including average scores per exercise
